First, let's clear out the current setup:

bashCopynpm uninstall shadcn-ui

Then use their proper CLI command:

bashCopynpm create @shadcn/ui@latest
When you run this, you'll get a series of prompts:

Would you like to proceed? › Yes
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › src/index.css
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › @/components
Configure the import alias for utilities: › @/lib/utils


After that completes, install the components you need:

bashCopynpx shadcn-ui@latest add button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add input
npx shadcn-ui@latest add scroll-area
npx shadcn-ui@latest add sheet
npx shadcn-ui@latest add slider
npx shadcn-ui@latest add switch
This should properly set up all the components and their dependencies. Let me know if you get any errors during this process!

First, make sure you're starting from a clean state:

bashCopynpm uninstall shadcn-ui @shadcn/ui

Now run this command instead:

bashCopynpx create-next-ui@latest vite
If that doesn't work, try this alternative:
bash
